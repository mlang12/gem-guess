# gem-guess

Welcome the simple Gem Guess game. 

The idea of the game is to click on the gems to accumulate points. By the end of the round you want your points to match the target in the top box. The gems will have an unknown value at the begining of each round and it is up to you to figure it out. 

Tech Used:
  -HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery
